Add NFT Check-In vApp proposal submission.md
This PR submits my vApp proposal for the NFT Check-In project.

Project Name: NFT Check-In
Category: Social
Description: Allows users to receive unique NFT stamps as proof of attendance or participation in events. Integrates Soundness Layer (SL) for secure user verification.

Features:
- Mint NFT stamps on user check-in
- Track participation history
- Verify identity via SL before minting

Timeline:
PoC (2-4 weeks): basic minting, SL integration, simple UI
MVP (4-8 weeks): full dashboard, production-ready smart contract, user testing
